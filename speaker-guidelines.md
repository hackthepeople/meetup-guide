# Speaker Guidelines

## What you should know when speaking at a Hack The People meetup

- Talks should be 10-15 minutes, with a subsequent 5 minute QA.

- Don't know what to speak about? Some suggestions:
  * topics related to social issues in technology,
  * topics related to education & knowledge sharing in technology,
  * specific project(s) you work(ed) on or are involved with,
  * introduction to a technology you're an expert in,
  * topics related to career development,
  * specific mentorship stories.

- Technical topics need to be presented in a way that makes them understandable to reasonably intelligent non-technical persons.

- We respect the time of the people attending our meetups, and start at the time indicated on the meetup page. If possible, please arrive 5-10 minutes before the start in order to get yourself setup for your talk.

- We encourage our speakers to stay for our small group sessions where everyone has a chance to speak about cool things they are working on and challenges encountered on the way.

- We do not allow any soliciting or selling of companies/products at our meetups.
