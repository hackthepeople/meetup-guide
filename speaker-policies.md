# Speaker Policies

## Who To Target For Speakers
- no more than 10000 twitter followers (under 1000 would be ideal)
- if you have to talk to their assistant, just walk away
- anyone who does any work in equality in technology and or education (knowledge sharing) in technology
- small group leads or projects leads able to speak about a certain project or storyline
- people with a different point of view (please take liberties with this)
- try asking people who haven't talked before or they haven't talked a bunch because they'll be the most enthused about presenting their ideas to the group
