# Speaker Policies

## Who To Target For Speakers

- No more than 10000 twitter followers (under 1000 would be ideal). This is a guideline to make sure you’re finding humans that are real people, not marketers. If someone is over this limit, talk to the national meetup organizer.
- If you have to talk to their assistant, just walk away
- Anyone who does any work in equality in technology and or education (knowledge sharing) in technology is ideal.
- Small group leads or projects leads able to speak about a certain project or storyline are also ideal contacts for speeches.
- People with a different point of view (please take liberties with this)
- Try asking people who haven't talked before or they haven't talked a bunch because they'll be the most enthused about presenting their ideas to the group
- No one who already belongs to or will be joining that HTP meetup if possible. Being a speaker makes you an authority, and it will start to create cliques if some people have been recognized as authorities and others have not.
- Other HTP groups in your area are prime targets to find a keynote speaker, as well as local meetup groups. If you are a bit lost, try contacting the organizers of any coding groups in your area (e.g. your city’s Python or Rails or UX/UI meetup group) and ask them to talk about social issues in technology. Everyone has something to say.
- __THIS IS NOT A COMPETITION__. You are not trying to find the biggest, most important person imaginable to speak, and you get no credit for finding someone who is willing to speak, but not participate in the group discussions. 
- They must be local and physically present at the meetup.
- Their topic should not be selling their company or any product, nor should it be so technical that a reasonably intelligent non-technical person would get nothing from the talk. 
- Their topic should be on social issues in technology, learning, informatics, or other topics that will interest everyone. Successful keynotes have had topics like “Autodidacticism: Teaching And Learning In Technology”, “Mentorship and Barriers To Networking”, and “Handling -ism in Tech with a Sense Of Humor”.
